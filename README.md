# resilient-networks
###### This was written with the help of [Fraida Fund](https://github.com/ffund), my mentor for the [ARISE Summer Research Program](http://engineering.nyu.edu/k12stem/arise/).

###### This experiment shows how redundant links can help aid recovery in the event of a network outage.

###### It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment, from start (reserving resources) to finish.
