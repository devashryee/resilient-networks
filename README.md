# resilient-networks
#### This experiment shows how redundant links can help aid recovery in the event of a network outage.
###### This was written with the help of [Fraida Fund](https://github.com/ffund), my mentor for the [ARISE Summer Research Program](http://engineering.nyu.edu/k12stem/arise/).
###### It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment, from start (reserving resources) to finish.
###### To reproduce this experiment on GENI, you will need an account on the [GENI Portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/SignMeUp), and you will need to have [joined a project](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/JoinAProject). You should have already [uploaded your SSH keys to the portal and know how to log in to a node with those keys](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/HowTo/LoginToNodes).

## Background
###### Today's networks lack the ability to respond gracefully to failure. The loss of network service impacts people deeply because of how reliant they are on technology. In this experiment, we tried designing network recovery paths for internet service providers using sharing links in the event of a network outage.
###### Network resiliency is defined as a network's ability to restore and recover services after facing issues, ranging from hackers, to natural disasters, to hardware malfunctions. Since network outages occur often, networks need improvements.
###### General ways of improving network resiliency include [adding redundant paths between nodes so that these nodes are still able to communicate even when main paths are down](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/37231/Sterbenz-Cetinkaya-Hameed-Jabbar-Qian-Rohrer-2011.pdf), and [improving network security so that hackers have a harder time accessing valuable data](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/37231/Sterbenz-Cetinkaya-Hameed-Jabbar-Qian-Rohrer-2011.pdf).

###### Offline time due to network outages has a negative effect on companies because they are inefficient and costly. In the summer of 2015, there were several outages which deeply hurt companies and individuals. On July 6th, 2015, a broken fiber optic cable disconnected the North Mariana Islands from the internet. [Downtime lasted for approximately two days and affected approximately 50,000 people](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/broken-cable-reportedly-disconnected-us-island-territory-from-internet/). The second event happened on July 8th, 2015, when a failed router brought down the United Airlines reservation system. Although downtime only lasted for 90 minutes, the outage led to [60 cancelled flights and 800 delayed flights](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-technical-problems-united-nyse-20150708-story.html). Lastly, on July 17th, 2015, vandals cut a fiber optic cable which took down the internet, phone and 911 services for thousands of AT&T and Verizon customers in three counties in California. [This incident has occurred 11 times in the past since July 2014 and downtime on this occasion lasted for approximately 22 hours](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/vandals-keep-snipping-fiber-optic-cables-in-california-with-impunity/).

###### Another way to potentially increase network resiliency is by sharing links. There are many redundant links between ISP routers that belong to different ISPs. If one ISP is experiencing a failure due to a network outage, the other ISP might be willing to carry the ISP’s network traffic on its own links temporarily. Overall, this agreement provides a safety net to all ISPs in case of an outage bringing down any one ISPs’ links.

###### To test the effects of sharing on two ISPs, we set up the network topology shown above. (Green represents ISP 1, purple represents ISP 2, lines represent links, and circles represent customers.) This topology consists of three nodes representing ISP routers, each connected to a neighbouring router by two separate links, belonging to two different ISPs. Each ISP router is then connected to two other nodes which represents a customer of each ISP. To create one, two, three, or four outages, we brought down the specific links shown above.
