# resilient-networks
#### This experiment shows how redundant links can help aid recovery in the event of a network outage.
###### This was written with the help of [Fraida Fund](https://github.com/ffund), my mentor for the [ARISE Summer Research Program](http://engineering.nyu.edu/k12stem/arise/).
###### It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment, from start (reserving resources) to finish.
###### To reproduce this experiment on GENI, you will need an account on the [GENI Portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/SignMeUp), and you will need to have [joined a project](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/JoinAProject). You should have already [uploaded your SSH keys to the portal and know how to log in to a node with those keys](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/HowTo/LoginToNodes).
